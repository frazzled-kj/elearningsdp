      <h2>Lesson: Anxiety & Trauma-Related Disorders</h2>
      <p class="small-note">
        This is a short textbook-style mini-lesson on how to distinguish generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, acute stress disorder, and PTSD.
      </p>

      <form id="instruction-baseline-form">
        <div class="q-block">
          <h3>Overview: Stress and Anxiety Disorders</h3>
          <p>
            Stress is the process by which we perceive and respond to events we appraise as threatening or challenging.
            Anxiety disorders involve excessive fear or anxiety that is difficult to control and causes distress or impairment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) involves excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for
            at least six months, about a number of events or activities. The worry is difficult to control and is often
            associated with restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Panic Disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, along with persistent concern or behavior change
            lasting at least one month after the attacks. Panic attacks are abrupt surges of intense fear that reach a peak
            within minutes and include physical symptoms such as heart palpitations or shortness of breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) involves symptoms that begin after a traumatic event and last from three days to one month.
            Symptoms can include intrusive memories, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) involves exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence,
            followed by intrusive symptoms, avoidance, negative changes in cognition and mood, and arousal changes.
            Duration is more than one month and symptoms cause functional impairment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Worked example 1 -->
        <div class="q-block">
          <h3>Worked Example 1</h3>
          <p>
            Maria was in a car accident two weeks ago. Since then, she has intrusive memories, difficulty sleeping, and irritability.
            Her symptoms began soon after the trauma and have lasted for under one month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analysis: Because these symptoms began after a traumatic event and have lasted less than one month,
            this pattern is consistent with acute stress disorder rather than PTSD.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Worked example 2 -->
        <div class="q-block">
          <h3>Worked Example 2</h3>
          <p>
            For the past eight months, Amir has felt on edge most days. He worries about grades, his parents' health,
            friendships, and money. He reports muscle tension and difficulty sleeping, and says he “cannot turn off” the worry.
            There was no single traumatic event that started these symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analysis: The long duration (more than six months), broad range of worries, and lack of a specific trauma
            point toward generalized anxiety disorder. The key cues are chronic, uncontrollable worry about many domains
            and physical symptoms such as muscle tension and sleep problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Worked example 3 -->
        <div class="q-block">
          <h3>Worked Example 3</h3>
          <p>
            Over the past month, Jordan has had several sudden episodes of intense fear that peak within minutes.
            During these episodes, Jordan feels short of breath, dizzy, and fears losing control. The episodes occur unexpectedly,
            and Jordan now avoids crowded spaces and worries about having another attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analysis: The abrupt, unexpected surges of fear, plus ongoing fear of future attacks and avoidance,
            match the pattern of panic disorder more than GAD or trauma-related disorders.
          </p>
