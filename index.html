        <h3>Understanding Anxiety and Trauma-Related Disorders</h3>
        <p>
          In clinical psychology, anxiety and stress-related disorders are grouped partly because they share overlapping symptoms such as worry, arousal, and avoidance. At the same time, each disorder has a distinctive pattern of cues that clinicians use to differentiate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</strong> involves persistent, excessive worry about a wide range of everyday issues (school, work, health, finances) for at least six months. People with GAD often describe feeling “on edge” most days, with muscle tension, sleep problems, and difficulty controlling their worry.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Panic Disorder</strong> centers on recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is a surge of intense fear that peaks within minutes, accompanied by symptoms like heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, or feelings of unreality. People with panic disorder often change their behavior to avoid potential attacks and worry persistently about future attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</strong> requires exposure to a traumatic event such as life-threatening violence, serious injury, or sexual assault. Key symptom clusters include intrusive memories or nightmares, avoidance of trauma reminders, negative changes in mood or thinking, and heightened arousal (for example, being jumpy or hyper-vigilant). Symptoms must last more than one month and cause functional impairment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)</strong> looks similar to PTSD but has a shorter time frame: from three days up to one month after the traumatic event. Dissociation (feeling detached or unreal) can be especially prominent. If symptoms persist beyond a month, a PTSD diagnosis may be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Adjustment Disorder</strong> occurs in response to a clear stressor (such as a breakup, move, or job loss) that is not necessarily life-threatening. Emotional or behavioral symptoms begin within three months of the stressor and cause more distress or impairment than would be expected, but the pattern does not meet criteria for another specific disorder and usually resolves within six months.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</strong> is characterized by obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images, or urges) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety or prevent a feared event). The anxiety is driven less by external situations and more by internal intrusive thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Historically, these disorders were grouped differently in diagnostic manuals, and their boundaries have shifted as research evolved. For example, PTSD was once considered an anxiety disorder but now appears in a separate trauma- and stressor-related category. However, many textbooks and exam prep resources still discuss them together because of the practical overlap in symptoms and assessment.

        <h4>Worked Examples</h4>

        <div class="question-block">
          <div class="question-title">Worked Example 1</div>
          <p>
            “Two months after a serious accident, a person reports nightmares, intrusive memories, avoidance of driving, and missing work due to constant tension and startle responses.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>Clinician reasoning:</strong> There is a clear traumatic event, symptoms last more than one month, and there is functional impairment. This matches the cue pattern for PTSD rather than Acute Stress Disorder, which would be shorter in duration, or Adjustment Disorder, which does not require trauma and typically involves milder symptom clusters.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <div class="question-title">Worked Example 2</div>
          <p>
            “A person describes chronic worry about grades, health, and family, most days for the past year. They feel restless, tense, and have trouble sleeping, but no specific trauma or panic attacks are reported.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>Clinician reasoning:</strong> The diffuse, long-term worry and physical tension without a single triggering event fits GAD better than PTSD, ASD, or Panic Disorder. Adjustment Disorder would require a more circumscribed stressor and a clearer time limit.
